# Programming two DC motors
https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7LKJLGIL0C9-programming-two-dc-motors
### - Program two DC motors using the L298N motor driver to perform the following movements:
   1. Forward for 30 seconds
   2. Backward for 1 minute
   3. Alternate left and right for 1 minute
       
### - After programming the motors, connect the Arduino to the LCD so that the name of the movement appears on the screen in conjunction with the motor movement. Use one of the communication protocols.

for that we need
| Name  | Quantity | Component |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| M1 M4 | 2 | DC Motor |
| U1 | 1 | H-bridge Motor Driver |
| U2 | 1 | Arduino Uno R3 |
| U4 | 1 | PCF8574-based, 39 (0x27) LCD 16 x 2 (I2C) |
| Bat4 | 1 | 4 batteries, AA, no 1.5V Battery |

<ins> There are other ways but this is what worked for me.</ins>
